# Working notes for the next model

A scratchpad for whoever picks this up (Astra, or another model): the
strategy principles the maintainer has stated, what the bots do about
each, and what is still open. Principles are quoted as given; evidence is
linked. Update this file when a principle is implemented or refuted.

## The point of the game

Score VP cheaply and keep maximum pressure on the opponent, while never
committing DEFCON suicide. Everything below is an instance of that.

## Principles from strong play

| Principle | Status in the bots | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Never play a suicide card or hand the opponent a fatal coup; plan the whole hand, not the current card. | Done: `bots/defcon.py` whole-hand survival search ranks every card, mode, event choice, discard, coup target and headline before VP. | `docs/DEFCON_STRATEGY.md`; seeds 2400-2403 in `logs/game-check`, all once nuclear losses, now end on VP. 0 nuclear losses in 64 strategic/event-value games. |
| Strong humans always event Grain Sales and Aldrich Ames, and event Terrorism when behind or with Iranian Hostage Crisis. | Noted, not implemented. The bots play these for Ops or space them. The learned hand-attack prior (`bots/opponent_model.py`) is therefore a bot base rate (<1%), not a human one. | `docs/DEFCON_STRATEGY.md` "How strong humans use the attack cards"; `models/opponent-model-v1.json.report.json`. |
| Blockade, Debt Crisis, traps: discards that fire no event are exits; self-trapping dumps Grain Sales / Voice of America / Colonial Rear Guards (USSR) or Decolonization (US). Red Scare + Blockade or a trap is lethal on the table (engine uses printed Ops). | Done in the planner (`trapped` state, pay-or-refuse). Printed-Ops leniency recorded in `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`. | Seed 2401 (Blockade paid away the last spare card) regression test. |
| Play around live scoring cards: a card still in the deck or the opponent's hand can score any round. Southeast Asia Scoring reaches only its own countries. Battleground control in an unscored region >>> in a scored one, and Mid War regions grow in value as turn 4 nears. | Done: importance x expected future scorings, discounted per turn away (`scoring_schedule`, `scoring_discount`, `scoring_hand`). | `docs/STRATEGIC_AI.md` "How it plays". |
| The deck schedule is static and public: no "future" uncertainty. | Done: `engine.cards.ENTRY_TURN` is the single source; bots use `bots/public_cards.card_state`. | |
| Influence value is not linear: control scores, uncontrolled influence has option value only, over-protection matters mainly where a coup is cheap. | Recorded as `progress_curve` / `reserve_stability` weights; defaults kept linear because with one action of lookahead the linear term is the option-value stand-in. Convex lost 0.33 ± 0.09. | `docs/STRATEGIC_AI.md`; `logs/game-check/shape-ab-convex-vs-linear-4000-4015.json`. |
| DEFCON is not worth much to either side in the Early War. Turn-1 battleground coups are often right (VP, Military Ops). | Done: no DEFCON charge on early coups. | |
| Battlegrounds >> cheap Southeast Asia countries >> other non-battlegrounds. Battleground Ops score domination/control or deny them; SEA countries non-dominate Asia and score later. | Done: `battleground` / `southeast_asia` / `control` tiers in `StrategicWeights`. A turn-1-only rule was tried first and removed as hacky. Tiers + coup discount vs the old flat tiers: 0.55 ± 0.06 on seeds 4000-4015 (0.72 as USSR, 0.38 as US). | `logs/game-check/3003-*` is the testing ground; `logs/game-check/tiers-ab-4000-4015.json`. |
| Coups/realignments should be valued like placement, generally preferring placement (Ops efficiency: a coup on a 2-stability country is -1 Op). | Done: same `delta` pricing, `coup_discount` 0.9. | |
| 1- and 2-stability countries are more VP per Op while their scoring is live. | Already what the influence search maximises (gain per Op); noted, nothing extra encoded. | |
| Blockade paid with a US/neutral 3-Ops card is great for the USSR; paid with De Gaulle / Socialist Governments / Suez Crisis it is good for the US (event never fires). Discards return at the reshuffle, so dumping Decolonization / De-Stalinization delays them, it does not remove them. | Noted, not priced: the pay choice scores flat minus printed Ops, and the USSR-seat sandbox assumes the US cannot pay (Blockade values 39.7 to the USSR, 0 to the US on the opening board). | `docs/DEFCON_STRATEGY.md` "Hand discard effects". |
| The opening is known: USSR 4 East Germany / 4 Poland / 1 Austria (or Yugoslavia); US 4 West Germany / 3 Italy, then the +2 handicap to Iran and West Germany. | Done: `OPENING_BOOK` in `bots/strategic.py`; the +2 is `rules.json` "setup_bonus", on in `main.py`, the trainer and the benchmark. The US 4/3 split is an assumption to confirm. | `docs/STRATEGIC_AI.md` "How it plays". |
| Judge a bot at checkpoints, not only by wins: VP scored plus the battleground control difference per region, weighted by how many more times and how soon each region scores (live card: this cycle and after the reshuffle; discarded: after it; Mid War: from turn 4; Southeast Asia once), each turn away discounted. | Done: `python -m struggler.bots.benchmark --stop-turn 1|3|7` (`projection`, `scoring_weights`). Turn 1 MCTS vs strategic is flat: -0.23 total, 8 wins / 9 losses on the 17 seats that searched. | `logs/game-check/*-4000-4015.t1*.json`; per-game logs with `--log-dir`. |

## Turn-1 review (seed 4004, and the opening board)

`logs/game-check/*.t1*.json` and the scratch table of every Early War
event's value on the opening board found, and fixed, in
`bots/strategic.py`: De-Stalinization played for Ops (not simulated: 23 of
101 events were), Nuclear Test Ban's 3 VP over 4 Ops (Ops priced flat at
2), Fidel spaced ahead of Decolonization (both collapsed to the space
value; one space slot now goes to the worst card), Five Year Plan carrying
a 25% "loss" at DEFCON 5 (chain risk now gated on DEFCON 2), and stakes in
already-reachable Eastern Europe earning access. New strategic vs the
previous strategic: 0.84, +11 VP mean, on seeds 4000-4015 both seatings
(`logs/game-check/strategic-new-vs-old-4000-4015.json`;
`python -m struggler.bots.benchmark --bot strategic --opponent strategic@<old strategic.py>`).

The VP weight against the new Ops scale: 3 / 6 / 10 score 0.81 / 0.88 /
0.88 against the previous strategic bot, and 6 and 10 score 0.45 and 0.50
against the current default (3) in mirror matches on the same seeds
(`logs/game-check/vp-*`). No signal at 32 games; the default stays 3.

### The VP-unit value function: tried, reverted, worth retrying

Commit 2d72916 (reverted by 3f3baad) put every weight in VP: a country =
its tier's VP per scoring x the region's expected remaining scorings; a
stake = control value x conversion ** (Ops still needed); reach = a share
of the option it opens, priced by its cost; the exact region score scaled
the same way; Red Scare/Containment = rounds x marginal Op value; CIA
Created = what the granted Op buys. The turn-1 table then read the way a
strong player reads it (Nasser = two USSR Ops, Nuclear Test Ban 3 against
a 4-Ops card's 12-16, COMECON free, Vietnam Revolts up for Thailand
reach). It lost anyway: 0.31 against its parent (ab50946), 0.125 after
three follow-ups (headline = event - half its action-round use, military
credit 0.5, every future scoring cycle counted), 0.20 with the cycles
off; seven weight ablations at the turn-3 checkpoint (tiers x3/x5/x8,
discount 0.6, region 0.4, access/reserve down) all trailed by 3-6 total.
The turn-3 battleground map showed it ceding Middle East and Asia while
taking Africa and South America. The unmeasured suspects are the stake
form (conversion odds vs the linear fraction), the reserve (0.16 VP vs
0.6 VP a point), and the region score's ten-times larger share. Evidence:
`logs/game-check/vpunits*`. The form is right; the calibration needs the
checkpoint benchmark one structural change at a time, not all at once.

UN Intervention is kept for the opponent's card in hand whose event hurts
most (`un_card`): that card's Ops are valued clean, the space slot skips
it, and UN alone is worth the harm it cancels. Measured neutral against
its parent (0.41 with a De-Stalinization relocation plan, 0.44 for the
plan alone, so the pairing itself is within noise); kept because it is
the stated principle (UN + Marshall Plan is four clean Ops).

Still wrong on that board, by human judgement: Marshall Plan at 13.6 (one
Op) is far too low, COMECON at 5.4 slightly high. Both are the same gap:
a stake is valued by its fraction of the way to control, not by its odds
of converting to control by scoring time and what that control would do
to domination. Flag events value 0. The VP weight (3) has not been
recalibrated to the new Ops scale.

## What is still open, roughly in order

1. Event Grain Sales, Aldrich Ames, Terrorism (with the Hostage doubling)
   in the strategic bot's event whitelist, then retrain
   `bots/opponent_model.py` on new logs so the hand-attack prior means
   something.
2. Scoring-card timing: the US in seed 3003 plays Asia Scoring at -6 on
   turn 1 AR6 with no Asia presence. The bot only has an urgency
   multiplier; it does not plan "build the region, then score".
3. Lone points: the bot places single points that die to 1-Op coups next
   turn (3003, turns 2-3: Colombia, Guatemala, Nigeria). Needs a rule for
   when a single point in an uncontrolled battleground is a liability.
4. The neural bot (`bots/event_value/`) covers 6 events; 59 deck cards can
   move a region's score. The scalable design is generic: fire every live
   card in a sandbox, drive choices with the strategic policy, aggregate
   exposure x swing per region. Not started. Head-to-head it is 0.53 ±
   0.06 against the strategic bot, i.e. indistinguishable.
5. Greedy is a dead opponent (0.00 against strategic). The trainer now
   anchors on frozen strategic weights; 32 games per candidate gives a
   standard error of 0.06, so detecting a 5-point gain needs ~4x that.

## How to look at things

The gate for any value-function change is `scripts/gate.sh [base-ref]`:
the turn-1 event-value table (`python -m struggler.bots.benchmark
--table`, read it by eye against your own judgement), the turn-3
checkpoint against the base commit, and full games against the base
commit and the pre-session bot (b2e8572). One structural change per
branch; it lands only when the table's disagreements shrink and neither
game check drops. When a check fails, bisect, do not tune.

```sh
# narrate a game: plays, events, influence moves, coups, DEFCON, scoring
STRUGGLER_OPPONENT_MODEL=models/opponent-model-v1.json \
  python src/main.py --us strategic --ussr strategic --seed 3003 \
  --log-level INFO --log-file game.log
# WARNING level prints only nuclear risk; DEBUG adds every action and the planner's numbers
# 16-seed paired A/B of a weight change against a rival checkpoint (8 workers, ~3 min)
python -m struggler.bots.train evaluate --opponent strategic --pairs 16 --seed 4000 \
  --rival rival.json --workers 8
```

`logs/game-check/` holds the evidence games (gitignored): `*-after-fix`,
`*-learned-priors`, `3003-*`, and the A/B reports. The baseline that every
change is measured against is seeds 4000-4015, both seatings.

## MCTS prototype follow-up

Speed and strength, seeds 4000-4015 both seatings, 24 simulations, vs
strategic (`logs/game-check/mcts-vs-strategic-4000-4015.*.json`):

| Rollout policy | Score | Nuclear losses | Search (s, 6-8 concurrent) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Full strategic policy in rollouts (before `bots/rollout.py`) | 0.656 | 0 | 11.3 |
| Immediate-only survival guard | 0.422 | 2 | 6.0 |
| Hybrid: full search when DEFCON <= 3 and a hazardous card is held | 0.469 | 0 | 4.6 |

The cheap rollouts cost strength: the search is 2.4x faster but the
rollouts are a worse model of play. Ablations (`STRUGGLER_ROLLOUT_OPTIONS`
`full_planner` / `serve_plans`) are the next measurement. The seed 4004
USSR turn-1 review shows the other weakness: 11 root macros over 24
simulations is 2-3 visits each, values within noise, and a targeted macro
forces a card (De-Stalinization, Duck and Cover) to be played for Ops.
Candidates: drop targets we are chasing (opponent present, we absent, no
adjacent control), no Ops macro when the event is worth more than the Ops,
cap macros at ~6 or raise simulations to 48.

An opt-in `mcts` bot now searches own scoring-card turns with UCT over card
plays and targeted BG investments. Rollout returns include banked VP plus
board potential, with terminal results overriding both. Tests cover the
same-final-board/different-scoring-order case, public-only hidden sampling,
safety, and actually investing before scoring. See `docs/STRATEGIC_AI.md`
"Experimental MCTS prototype" for usage and limits. The strategic bot's
urgency-only behavior remains unchanged. Next: measure paired-seat strength
and search cost before promoting this prototype or expanding its scope.

Speed follow-up: profiling the prototype led to exact evaluation caching,
control-aware regional rescoring, deduplicated realignment evaluation, and
cheaper isolated observations/information keys. Three alternating local
runs measured 1.44x strategic and 1.61x MCTS speedups with identical rankings
and root values. See `docs/STRATEGIC_AI.md` for workloads and evidence.

The simplification audit is in `docs/STRATEGIC_SIMPLIFICATION.md`: all 16
weights are used; ten feed the MCTS leaf and six only its strategic policy.
First candidates are fixing the three default-neutral knobs, then testing
neutral coup discount and urgency. The audit includes a 150-position
sensitivity check and a separate-leaf ablation plan. No weights changed.
